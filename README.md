# textGNN


This repository provides a reference implementation of **textGNN-R** as described in the article:
```
   textGNN-R_Graph_Structural_Text_Retrieval.pdf
```
Justin Carpenter.


The textGNN-R algorithm transforms text documents from applicaitons such as Q&A forums into graph representaions which allows us to create subgraphs on the graph representation and do graph classification to find and return the search query.  

This approach is a step into this unexplored field and is semi-functional but is not achieving the preformance goals when beginning this exploration. Future continuation on this approach might continue and others are welcome to contribute to the corrections/improvements needed for it to stand out as a good alternative approach to traditional reverse indexing approaches.
